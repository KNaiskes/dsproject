Distributed Project

A Raspberry Pi is used as a MQTT sever and several esp8266 or esp32 microcontrollers connect to it and send it sensor information.

Sensors that have been used 

-Motion sensor
-Temperature and Humidity sensor
-Light sensor

Microcontrollers run the Micropython framwerok while the Raspberry Pi runs Rasbian testing. 
Flask has been used to represent the information
